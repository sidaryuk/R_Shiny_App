As Group Findik, we are delighted to introduce our shining application focused on the happiness reports of 158 countries. Within our presentation, we have curated four distinct tabs: Summary, Histogram, Plot, and Regression, each meticulously designed to provide comprehensive insights
## Summary
![summary](https://github.com/sidaryuk/R_Shiny_App/assets/161333970/f5d28a02-0517-463b-b590-c46e2f5aad44)
This observation contains 158 of 12 variables. 2 of them are characters which are reigon and country. The other 10 are numeric variables as happiness rank, happiness score, standard error, economy, family, health, freedom, trust government corruption, generosity and dystopia residual. All of the other information about the data can be seen in the app and from the link included 
In this panel, the summary of our data is available. On the left side, you can choose the variable and how many observation you want to calculate. On the right side, the app gives you the summary statistics and the observations that the code includes while calculating.
## Histogram
![histogram](https://github.com/sidaryuk/R_Shiny_App/assets/161333970/12d9dfc3-16b2-4ad4-89b4-c5758e72d852)
On the histogram tab, we can choose the region and get the happines score of the countries that are included in that region. By this histogram, you may compare the countries or the regions in a visual presented way
## Plot
![plot](https://github.com/sidaryuk/R_Shiny_App/assets/161333970/2604bc3f-ce98-4c80-821d-45e7c8540ab0)
The aim of this plot is to see the relationship between variables. X is my independent variable and y is the dependent varibale. For instance, we have choosen Y to be happiness score in this examination. For example let me choose economy and Show you the relationship. And then if we choose the sample size to 158 and choose smooth, a positive linear relationship can be displayed. Also other variables can be choosen as Y too.
## Regression

Finally, we have the multiple regression tab. In this part, we have dependent and independent variables to choose to calculate. Our aim is to not only reflect our data in means of visuals, but also in statistical analysis. You can see our linear model formula, residuals, coefficients, significance, standart error, r square and F ststistic. All of the calculations about any variable can be done very easily with this tab.
